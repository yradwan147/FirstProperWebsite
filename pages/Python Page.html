        <h3>Founder of Python and its creation</h3>
        <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a 
            successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL), capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. 
            Its implementation began in December 1989. Guido is Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others. </p>
        <u1>
            <li>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.</li> 
            <li>Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.</li>

        <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and 
            aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods)). Many other paradigms are supported via 
            extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.</p>
        <p>Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector 
            for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution. </p>
        <h4>The philosophy behind the design of the langauge can be summarized in the words of the document "The Zen of Python" which are as follows:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Beautiful is better than ugly</li>
            <li>Explicit is better than implicit</li>
            <li>Simple is better than complex</li>
            <li>Complex is better than complicated</li>
            <li>Readability Counts</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Syntax and Semantics</h3>
        <p>Python was made to be an easily readable language for even non-programmers. It's main idea was to as closely as possible resemble plain pseudocode
            that anyone could understand without much issues.
        </p>
        <p>Python uses a different type of structuring in comparison to other languages. Rather than using brackets and parentheses, python focuses on the use of
            indentation and colons to separate its different functions. Thus the transition from any other language to python isn't the most smooth but that isn't the
            point. As python was made to be the perfect beginner's language that can give a swift and simple introduction to programming as a whole.
        </p>
        <h4>Any programming language has different statements and python is no different. Its version of these statements are listed as follows:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>the <em>if</em> statement along with <em>else</em> and the language's <em>elif</em> which resembles else if</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><div class = "code"> 
                if condition : <br>
                <span class = "tab">action1 </span> <br>
                elif condition : <br>
                <span class = "tab">action2 </span> <br>
                else : <br>
                <span class = "tab">action3 </span> <br>
            </div></li>
            <li>the <em>for</em> loop</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><div class = "code"> 
                for i in range (no. of iterations) : <br>
                <span class = "tab">i++ </span> <br>
            </div></li>
            <li>the <em>while</em> loop</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><div class = "code"> 
                while (condition) : <br>
                <span class = "tab">action </span> <br>
            </div></li>
            <li>and many others...</li>
        </ul>
