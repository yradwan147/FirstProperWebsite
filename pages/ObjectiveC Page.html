        <h3>Founder of ObjectiveC and its creation</h3>
        <p>Objective-C was created primarily by Brad Cox and Tom Love in the early 1980s at their company Productivity Products International.[5]
            Leading up to the creation of their company, both had been introduced to Smalltalk while at ITT Corporation's Programming Technology Center in 1981. The earliest work on Objective-C traces back to around that time. 
            Cox was intrigued by problems of true reusability in software design and programming. He realized that a language like Smalltalk would be invaluable in building development environments for system developers at ITT. 
            However, he and Tom Love also recognized that backward compatibility with C was critically important in ITT's telecom engineering milieu.
            Cox began writing a pre-processor for C to add some of the abilities of Smalltalk. He soon had a working implementation of an object-oriented extension to the C language, which he called "OOPC" for Object-Oriented Pre-Compiler.</p>
        <p>Love and Cox eventually formed PPI to commercialize their product, which coupled an Objective-C compiler with class libraries. In 1986, Cox published the main description of Objective-C in its original form in the book Object-Oriented Programming, An Evolutionary Approach.</p>

        <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Objective-C is the primary programming language you use when writing software for OS X and iOS. Itâ€™s a superset of the C programming language and provides object-oriented capabilities and a dynamic runtime. 
            Objective-C inherits the syntax, primitive types, and flow control statements of C and adds syntax for defining classes and methods. 
            It also adds language-level support for object graph management and object literals while providing dynamic typing and binding, deferring many responsibilities until runtime.</p>
        <p>Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. 
            It was the main programming language supported by Apple for macOS, iOS, and their respective application programming interfaces (APIs), Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, until the introduction of Swift in 2014. </p>
        <p>After acquiring NeXT in 1996, Apple Computer used OpenStep in its then-new operating system, Mac OS X. This included Objective-C, NeXT's Objective-C-based developer tool, Project Builder, and its interface design tool, Interface Builder, both now merged into one application, Xcode. 
            Most of Apple's current Cocoa API is based on OpenStep interface objects and is the most significant Objective-C environment being used for active development.</p>

            <h4>At WWDC 2014, Apple introduced a new language, Swift, which was characterized as "Objective-C without the C".</h4>

        <h3>Syntax and Semantics</h3>
        <p>Objective-C is a thin layer atop C and is a "strict superset" of C, meaning that it is possible to compile any C program with an Objective-C compiler and to freely include C language code within an Objective-C class.
            Objective-C derives its object syntax from Smalltalk. All of the syntax for non-object-oriented operations (including primitive variables, pre-processing, expressions, function declarations, 
            and function calls) are identical to those of C, while the syntax for object-oriented features is an implementation of Smalltalk-style messaging. 
        </p>
        <p>The Objective-C model of object-oriented programming is based on message passing to object instances. In Objective-C one does not call a method; one sends a message. This is unlike the Simula-style programming model used by C++. 
            The difference between these two concepts is in how the code referenced by the method or message name is executed. In a Simula-style language, the method name is in most cases bound to a section of code in the target class by the compiler. 
            In Smalltalk and Objective-C, the target of a message is resolved at runtime, with the receiving object itself interpreting the message.
        </p>
        <h4>Any programming language has different statements and ObjectiveC is no different. Its version of these statements are listed as follows:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>the <em>if</em> statement along with <em>else</em> and else if</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><div class = "code"> 
                if (condition) { <br>
                <span class = "tab">action1 </span> <br>
                } else if (condition) { <br>
                <span class = "tab">action2 </span> <br>
                } else { <br>
                <span class = "tab">action3 </span> <br>
                }
            </div></li>
            <li>the <em>for</em> loop</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><div class = "code"> 
                for( init; condition; increment ) { <br>
                <span class = "tab">i++ </span> <br>
                } 
            </div></li>
            <li>the <em>while</em> loop</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><div class = "code"> 
                while (condition) { <br>
                <span class = "tab">action </span> <br>
                }
            </div></li>
            <li>and many others...</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Its most popular uses</h3>
        <span style = "font-size: 1.3em;">
        <p>Objective-C is the primary programming language you use when writing software for OS X and iOS. It also adds language-level support for object graph management 
            and object literals while providing dynamic typing and binding, deferring many responsibilities until runtime.</p>
        <p>Objective-C today is often used in tandem with a fixed library of standard objects (often known as a "kit" or "framework"), such as Cocoa, GNUstep or ObjFW. 
            These libraries often come with the operating system: the GNUstep libraries often come with Linux-based distributions and Cocoa comes with macOS.</p>
        <p>Objective-C allows for the declaration of new root classes that do not inherit any existing functionality.</p>
        </span>

            <li>2081 companies reportedly use Objective-C in their tech stacks, including Uber, Pinterest, and Instagram.</li>
            <li>4526 developers on StackShare have stated that they use Objective-C.</li>
            <li>Sentry, Bazel, imgix, Cocoa Touch (iOS), and Swagger Codegen are some of the popular tools that integrate with Objective-C.</li>
