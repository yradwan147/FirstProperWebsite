        <h3>Founder of SQL and its creation</h3>
        <p>The SQL programming language was first developed in the 1970s by IBM researchers
            Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. The programming language, known then as SEQUEL,
            was created following the publishing of Edgar Frank Todd's paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks," in 1970. <br>
            Chamberlin and Boyce's first attempt at a relational database language was Square, but it was difficult to use due to subscript notation. After moving to the San Jose Research Laboratory in 1973, they began work on SEQUEL.
            The acronym SEQUEL was later changed to SQL because "SEQUEL" was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Engineering Limited company.</p>

        <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
        <p>SQL is a programming language that intermediary between the database client software and the database itself  .</p>

        <p>SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), 
            or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
            and  offers two main advantages over older read write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly,
            it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.

        <h3>Syntax and Semantics</h3>
        <p>The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:
        </p>
        <h4>Any programming language has different statements and SQL is no different. Its version of these statements are listed as follows:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Clauses</em>, which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.)</li>
            <li><em>Expressions</em>, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows of data</li>
            <li><em>Predicates</em>, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) (true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow.</li>
            <li><em>Queries</em>, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of SQL.</li>
            <li><em>Statements</em>, which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics.</li>
            <li>SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar.<br>
                Insignificant whitespace is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability.</li>
