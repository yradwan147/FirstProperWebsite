<h3>How it started</h3>
<p>The C++ programming language has a history going back to 1979, when Bjarne Stroustrup was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis. One of the languages Stroustrup had the opportunity to work with was a language called Simula, which as the name implies is a language primarily designed for simulations. The Simula 67 language - which was the variant that Stroustrup worked with - is regarded as the first language to support the object-oriented programming paradigm. Stroustrup found that this paradigm was very useful for software development, however the Simula language was far too slow for practical use.
Shortly thereafter, he began work on "C with Classes", which as the name implies was meant to be a superset of the C language. His goal was to add object-oriented programming into the C language, which was and still is a language well-respected for its portability without sacrificing speed or low-level functionality. His language included classes, basic inheritance, inlining, default function arguments, and strong type checking in addition to all the features of the C language.
The first C with Classes compiler was called Cfront, which was derived from a C compiler called CPre. It was a program designed to translate C with Classes code to ordinary C. A rather interesting point worth noting is that Cfront was written mostly in C with Classes, making it a self-hosting compiler (a compiler that can compile itself). Cfront would later be abandoned in 1993 after it became difficult to integrate new features into it, namely C++ exceptions. Nonetheless, Cfront made a huge impact on the implementations of future compilers and on the Unix operating system.

<h3>What is C++ and it's uses</h3>
<p> C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.
</p>
<h4>Uses:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Games
C++ is close to the hardware, can easily manipulate resources, provide procedural programming over CPU intensive functions and is fast. It is also able to override the complexities of 3D games and provides multilayer networking. All these benefits of C++ make it a primary choice to develop the gaming systems as well as game development suites.
</li>
<br></br>
<li>GUI Based Applications
C++ can be used to develop most of the GUI based and desktop applications easily as it has got the required features.
Some examples of GUI based applications, written in C++, are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Most of the applications of the adobe systems including Illustrator, Photoshop, etc. are developed using C++.</li>
<li>Win amp media player from Microsoft is a popular software that has been catering to all our audio/video needs for decades now. This software is developed in C++.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br></br>
<li>
Database Software
C++ is also used in writing database management software. The two most popular databases MySQL and Postgres are written in C++.
<ul>
<li>MySQL
one of the most popular database software that is used widely in many real-world applications is written in C++.
This is the world’s most popular open-source database. This database is written in C++ and is used by most of the organizations.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br></br>
<li>Operating Systems
The fact that C++ is a strongly typed and fast programming language makes it an ideal candidate for writing operating systems. In addition to this, C++ has a wide collection of system-level functions that also help in writing low-level programs.
<ul><li>Apple OS X has some of its parts written in C++. Similarly, some parts of the iPod are also written in C++.</li>
<li>Most of the software from Microsoft is developed using C++ (flavors of Visual C++). Applications like Windows 95, ME, 98; XP, etc. are written in C++. Apart from this, the IDE Visual Studio, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office are also written in C++.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br></br>
<li>Advanced Computation And Graphics
C++ is useful in developing an application that requires high-performance image processing, real-time physical simulations, and mobile sensor applications that need high performance and speed.</li>

<h3>C++ Basics</h3>
<h4>Types of variables</h4>
<p>variables can be categorised based on their data type. For example, in the above example we have seen integer types variables.Following are the types of variables available in C++.</p>
<ul>
<li>
int: These type of of variables holds integer value.
</li>
<li>
char: holds character value like ‘c’, ‘F’, ‘B’, ‘p’, ‘q’ etc.</li>
<li>
bool: holds boolean value true or false.
</li>
<li>
double: double-precision floating point value.
</li>
<li>	
float: Single-precision floating point value.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>If statement in C++</h4>
<p>If statement consists a condition, followed by statement or a set of statements as shown below:

if(condition){
  Statement(s);
}
The statements inside if parenthesis (usually referred as if body) gets executed only when the given condition is true. If the condition is false then the statements inside if body are completely ignored.</p>
<h4>While Loop</h4>
<p>in while loop, condition is evaluated first and if it returns true then the statements inside while loop execute, this happens repeatedly until the condition returns false. When condition returns false, the control comes out of loop and jumps to the next statement in the program after while loop.n while loop, condition is evaluated first and if it returns true then the statements inside while loop execute, this happens repeatedly until the condition returns false. When condition returns false, the control comes out of loop and jumps to the next statement in the program after while loop.</p>
