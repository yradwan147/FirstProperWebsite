        <h3>History:</h3>
        <p style=font-size:17px;>During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a managed code compiler system called "Simple Managed C" (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object Oriented Language". Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.</p>

        <h3>Design Goals:</h3>
        <ul style=font-size:17px;>
		<li>The language is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.</li><br>
		<li>The language, and implementations thereof, should provide support for software engineering principles such as strong type checking, array bounds checking, detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection. Software robustness, durability, and programmer productivity are important.</li><br>
		<li>The language is intended for use in developing software components suitable for deployment in distributed environments.</li><br>
		<li>Portability is very important for source code and programmers, especially those already familiar with C and C++.</li><br>
		<li>Support for internationalization is very important.</li><br>
		<li>C# is intended to be suitable for writing applications for both hosted and embedded systems, ranging from the very large that use sophisticated operating systems, down to the very small having dedicated functions.</li><br>
		<li>Although C# applications are intended to be economical with regard to memory and processing power requirements, the language was not intended to compete directly on performance and size with C or assembly language.</li><br>

		Like other general-purpose programming languages, C# can be used to create a number of different programs and applications: mobile apps, desktop apps, cloud-based services, websites, enterprise software and games. Lots and lots of games. While C# is remarkably versatile, there are three areas in which it is most commonly used.

Website development
C# is often used to develop professional, dynamic websites on the .NET platform, or open-source software. So, even if you’re not a fan of the Microsoft architecture, you can still use C# to create a fully-functional website. Because this language is object-oriented, it is often utilized to develop websites that are incredibly efficient, easily scalable and a breeze to maintain.

Windows applications
C# was created by Microsoft for Microsoft, so it’s easy to see why it’s most popularly used for the development of Windows desktop applications. C# applications require the Windows .NET framework in order to function at their best, so the strongest use case for this language is developing applications and programs that are specific to the architecture of the Microsoft platform.

Games
Do you have an interest in creating games? C# might just be one of the best programming languages for gaming. This language is heavily used to create fan-favorite games like Rimworld on the Unity Game Engine.

Just in case you weren’t already aware, Unity is by far the most popular game engine available, on which more than a third of the industry’s best and most commonly-played games were built. C# integrates seamlessly with the Unity engine and can be used on virtually any modern mobile device or console thanks to cross-platform tech like Xamarin.
