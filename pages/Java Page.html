<section>
<h3>How it started</h3>
<p>Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).

The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.</p>

<h3>What is Java and it's uses</h3>
<p> Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).

The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.</p>
<h4>Uses:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
Web-based Applications

Java is also used to develop web applications. It provides a vast support for web applications through Servlets, Struts or JSPs. With the help of these technologies, you can develop any kind of web application that you require. The easy coding and high security offered by this programming language allow the development of a large number of applications for health, social security, education, and insurance.
</li>
<br></br>
<li>
Enterprise Applications

Java is the first choice of many software developers for writing applications and Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) is a very popular platform that provides API and runtime environment for scripting. It also includes network applications and web-services. JavaEE is also considered as the backbone for a variety of banking applications which have Java running on the UI to back server end.
</li>
<br></br>
<li>
Scientific Applications

Sofware developers see Java is the weapon of choice when it comes to coding the scientific calculations and mathematical operations. These programs are designed to be highly secure and lighting fast. they support a higher degree of portability and offer low maintenance. Some of the most powerful applications like the MATLAB use Java for interacting user interface as well as part of the core system.
</li>
<br></br>
<li>
Gaming Applications
Java has the support of the open-source most powerful 3D-Engine, the jMonkeyEngine that has the unparalleled capability when it comes to the designing of 3D games. However, it does cause an occasional latency issue for games as garbage collection cycles can cause noticeable pauses. This issue will be solved in the newer versions of JVMs.

<h3>Java Basics</h3>
<h4>Java Functions</h4>
<p>Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of the same type. However, an array itself is an object on the heap. We will look into how to declare, construct, and initialize in the upcoming chapters.</p>
<h4>Java Enums</h4>
<p>Enums were introduced in Java 5.0. Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums.

With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in your code.</p>
