        <h3>Founder of Ruby and its creation</h3>
        <p>Ruby is a programming language invented by yukihiro matsumoto in 1995 and this name originated during an online chat session between matsumoto and keiju ishitsuka on februry 24,1993 before any code 
            had been written for the language initially two names were proposed coral and Ruby. matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing name Ruby .it was birthstone of one of his colleages. .</p>

        <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Ruby is an interpreted typed and uses garbage collection. it supports multiple programming paradigms. including procedural object oriented and fuctional programing according to creator 
            Ruby was influenced by perl,smaltalk, effile,ada.basic and lisp  .</p>

        <p>Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity. it has an elegant syntax that natural to read and write Since its public release in 1995, Ruby has drawn devoted coders worldwide. In 2006, Ruby achieved mass acceptance. With active user groups formed in the worldï¿½s major cities and Ruby-related conferences filled to capacity.

           Ruby-Talk, the primary mailing list for discussion of the Ruby language, climbed to an average of 200 messages per day in 2006. It has dropped in recent years as the size of the community pushed discussion from one central list into many smaller groups.

           Ruby is ranked among the top 10 on most of the indices that measure the growth and popularity of programming languages worldwide (such as the TIOBE index). Much of the growth is attributed to the popularity of software written in Ruby, particularly the Ruby on Rails web framework.

           Ruby is also completely free. Not only free of charge, but also free to use, copy, modify, and distribute.

        <h3>Syntax and Semantics</h3>
        <p>Ruby is object-oriented: every value is an object, including classes and instances of types that many other languages designate as primitives (such as integers, booleans, and "null"). 
            Variables always hold references to objects. Every function is a method and methods are always called on an object. Methods defined at the top level scope become methods of the Object class.
        </p>
        <p>The syntax of Ruby is broadly similar to that of Perl and Python. Class and method definitions are signaled by keywords, whereas code blocks can be defined by either keywords or braces. In contrast to Perl, variables are not obligatorily prefixed with a sigil. 
            When used, the sigil changes the semantics of scope of the variable. For practical purposes there is no distinction between expressions and statements.[101][102] Line breaks are significant and taken as the end of a statement; 
            a semicolon may be equivalently used. Unlike Python, indentation is not significant. One of the differences from Python and Perl is that Ruby keeps all of its instance variables completely private to the class and only exposes them through accessor methods (attr_writer, attr_reader, etc.).
        </p>
        <h4>Any programming language has different statements and python is no different. Its version of these statements are listed as follows:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>the <em>if</em> statement along with <em>else</em> and the language's <em>elsif</em> which resembles else if</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><div class = "code"> 
                if condition <br>
                <span class = "tab">action1 </span> <br>
                elsif condition <br>
                <span class = "tab">action2 </span> <br>
                else <br>
                <span class = "tab">action3 </span> <br>
                end
            </div></li>
            <li>the <em>for</em> loop</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><div class = "code"> 
                for i in expression <br>
                <span class = "tab">i++ </span> <br>
                end
            </div></li>
            <li>the <em>while</em> loop</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><div class = "code"> 
                while (condition) <br>
                <span class = "tab">action </span> <br>
                end
            </div></li>
            <li>and many others...</li>
